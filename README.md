# GraphQL

1. GraphQL = Graph Query Language
1. Any client (web, mobile, server), any language, any database
1. Because you write your query on the client, the client controls what data you get
    - Not the server
    - With a rest api, it is the server that determines what is returned
1. Fewer http requests
    - Flexible data querying
    - Less code to manage...
1. GraphQL is self documenting
